## How to Search for Lost Bitcoin & Ethereum Wallets with Balance

**Wallet Gen** can search for crypto wallets with balances.

### For Bitcoin (BTC) wallets:

*   Choose option 3 in the menu or run start_search_btc.bat to search Bitcoin wallets via the internet.
*   Select option 6 to search Bitcoin wallets using the database.

### For EVM wallets (Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, etc.):

*   Choose option 5 or run start_search_evm.bat to search EVM wallets via the internet.
*   Choose option 6 to search EVM wallets using the database.

## The Program Found a Wallet — What’s Next?

When the program finds a wallet with a balance:
*   It stops immediately.
*   It displays the wallet details in the console.
*   This data is saved in the ``found_wallets.txt`` file.

### How to Access the Funds?
1.  Import the **mnemonic seed phrase** from the found wallet into any compatible crypto wallet.
2.  You’ll be able to transfer the funds to your own wallet.

## Recovery Your Bitcoin Wallet

WalletGen has the ability to recover Bitcoin wallets by seed phrase (mnemonic phrase).

### Process Description

#### Search for missing words:

If the seed phrase is missing words, use * as a placeholder.

#### Entering a complete seed-phrase:

Enter the full 12-word seed.

### Important recommendations

*   Seed-phrase must contain exactly 12 words.
*   Use only the * symbol to search for missing words.
*   Searching for missing words may take considerable time.
*   Successful recovery stops the program and saves data.

## My Finds

![mywallet](/image/view.webp)

I’ve recovered two BTC wallets with a balance. The first had 0.000032 BTC, the second contained 0.0528 BTC (roughly $4800 at the time of discovery).
Here’s the link to the wallet: [bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay](https://mempool.space/address/bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay).
